"Be careful with my telescope. I\'ve waited my whole life for tonight." Owl spoke with a kind of\n    didactic inflection, professorially punctauting each syllable. Anybody with any sense considered\n    Owl to be the very wisest on the matter of heaven-gazing. He was almost the wisest of all the animals, save perhaps for\n    Mistress Badger.\n    <p>"You had your turn!" said Chipmunk.\n    <p>Owl scarcely noticed the boys, as he was now fully engaged in his own lecture. "Halley\'s Comet appears in the heavens only\n    once every quarter-century. I saw it once before, as a very young Owl." Tears welled in his eyes. "And tonight, I shall see\n    it again!"\n    <p>"When will we see it?" asked Squirrel, grabbing the telescope again.\n    <p>"Soon," said Owl. "Very soon. And with my beautiful telescope, at last I will see it close!"\n    <p>"Can\'t you just fly up with your wings?" asked the Squirrel.\n    <p>"Mine!" cried the Chipmunk, tugging the telescope again.\n    <p>"No, mine!" shouted Squirrel.\n    <p>The Badger, who had been quiet the entire time said: "Boys, oughten we be careful with Owl\'s telescope?"\n    <p>Just as words were out of her mouth, the telescope tumbled.
